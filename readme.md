# SaaS Company Landing Page

This is a learning project. Huge thanks to Brad Traversy's youtube channel.

This project is from the site [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/?ref=traversy) challenge website and does not use any frameworks or libraries. It is built with pure HTML and CSS and a bit of JS for the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.
